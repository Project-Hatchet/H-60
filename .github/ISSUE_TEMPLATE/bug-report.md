2.	Environment
The environment for every application can vary widely, but be as specific as you can. Testers should always follow the given bug report template unless otherwise specified — it helps cut down on unnecessary information.

Device: What type of hardware are you using? Which specific model?
OS: Which version number of the OS has displayed the issue?
Account Used: This matters if testers are given test accounts by the client. it’s best to then include email + password in the issue report. When the developers get the bug they understand which account was used to discover the issue.
Testing App Version: Which version number of the application are you testing? Simply writing “latest version” or “App Store Version” won’t cut it, since some bugs are version-specific and it’s hard to know the app store version when searching the store at a later date – make sure your testers include this specific information.
Connection type (if applicable): If the application you’re testing is reliant on Internet connectivity, are you on WiFi, Ethernet, or cellular data? What is the speed of the connection?
Reproducibility Rate: How many times have you been able to reproduce the error, using the exact steps you’ve taken to activate the bug? It’s also useful to report how many times the bug has been reproduced vs. the number of attempts it’s taken to reproduce the issue, in case it’s an intermittent occurrence.
